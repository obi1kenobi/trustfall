[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import trustfall`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the
# `#[pymodule]` in `src/lib.rs`.

# This library is only going to be used from Python, so rustdoc for it is of limited use.

#
# Downstream Rust code (including any code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
