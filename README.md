# `trustfall` — How to Query (Almost) Everything

This repository contains the `trustfall` query engine, which can be used to query any data source
or combination of data sources: databases, APIs, raw files (JSON, CSV, etc.), git version control,
etc. For a 10min video introduction to the project, see
the ["How to Query (Almost) Everything" talk](https://www.hytradboi.com/2022/how-to-query-almost-everything)
from the [HYTRADBOI 2022](https://www.hytradboi.com/) conference.

![Terminal recording of running `cargo run --release -- query example_queries/actions_in_repos_with_min_10_hn_pts.ron` in the `demo-hytradboi` demo project. The system returns the first 20 results of the query in 6.36 seconds."](./demo-hytradboi/query-demo.gif)

*Demo showing the execution of the cross-API query: "Which GitHub Actions are used in projects on the front page of HackerNews with >=10 points?"*

The demo executes the following query across the HackerNews and GitHub APIs and over the YAML-formatted GitHub repository workflow files:
```graphql
{
  HackerNewsTop(max: 200) {
    ... on HackerNewsStory {
      hn_score: score @filter(op: ">=", value: ["$min_score"]) @output

      link {
        ... on GitHubRepository {
          repo_url: url @output

          workflows {
            workflow: name @output
            workflow_path: path @output

            jobs {
              job: name @output

              step {
                ... on GitHubActionsImportedStep {
                  step: name @output
                  action: uses @output
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This demo is part of the ["How to Query (Almost) Everything"
talk](https://www.hytradboi.com/2022/how-to-query-almost-everything) from the
[HYTRADBOI 2022](https://www.hytradboi.com/) conference. Instructions for
running the demo are available together with the source code in the
`demo-hytradboi` directory: [link](./demo-hytradboi).

## Example Trustfall implementations

- [HackerNews APIs](./trustfall/examples/hackernews/), including an overview of the query language
  and an example of querying REST APIs.
- [RSS/Atom feeds](./trustfall/examples/feeds/), showing how to query structured data
  like RSS/Atom feeds.
- [airport weather data (METAR)](./trustfall/examples/weather), showing how to query CSV data from
  aviation weather reports.

## Using Trustfall over a new data source

The easiest way to plug in a new data source is by implementing
[the `BasicAdapter` trait](https://docs.rs/trustfall_core/latest/trustfall_core/interpreter/basic_adapter/trait.BasicAdapter.html).

Python bindings are available, and are built automatically on every change to
the engine; the most recent version may be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/releases). A getting started
guide for Python is forthcoming ([tracking
issue](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/issues/16)); in the meantime, the
best resource is the Python bindings' [test suite](./pytrustfall/trustfall/tests/test_execution.py).

## Directory Registry

- [`trustfall`](./trustfall/) is a façade crate. This is the preferred way to use Trustfall.
- [`trustfall_core`](./trustfall_core/) contains the query engine internals
- [`trustfall_derive`](./trustfall_derive/) defines macros that simplify plugging in data sources.
- [`pytrustfall`](./pytrustfall/) contains Trustfall's Python bindings
- [`trustfall_wasm`](./trustfall_wasm/) is a WASM build of Trustfall
- [`trustfall_filetests_macros`](./trustfall_filetests_macros/) is a procedural
  macro used to generate test cases defined by files: they ensure that the
  function under test, when given an input specified by one file, produces an
  output equivalent to the contents of another file.
- [`experiments`](./experiments/) contains various experimental projects
  such as the [Trustfall web playground](https://play.predr.ag/).
