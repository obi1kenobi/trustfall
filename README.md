# `trustfall` â€” How to Query (Almost) Everything

This repository contains the `trustfall` query engine, which can be used to query any data source
or combination of data sources: databases, APIs, raw files (JSON, CSV, etc.), git version control,
etc. For a 10min video introduction to the project, see
the ["How to Query (Almost) Everything" talk](https://www.hytradboi.com/2022/how-to-query-almost-everything)
from the [HYTRADBOI 2022](https://www.hytradboi.com/) conference.

![Terminal recording of running `cargo run --release -- query example_queries/actions_in_repos_with_min_10_hn_pts.ron` in the `demo-hytradboi` demo project.

*Demo showing the execution of the cross-API query: "Which GitHub Actions are used in projects on the front page of HackerNews with >=10 points?"*

The demo executes the following query across the HackerNews and GitHub APIs and over the YAML-formatted GitHub repository workflow files:
```graphql
{
  HackerNewsTop(max: 200) {
    ... on HackerNewsStory {
      hn_score: score @filter(op: ">=", value: ["$min_score"]) @output

      link {
        ... on GitHubRepository {
          repo_url: url @output

          workflows {
            workflow: name @output
            workflow_path: path @output

            jobs {
              job: name @output

              step {
                ... on GitHubActionsImportedStep {
                  step: name @output
                  action: uses @output
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This demo is part of the ["How to Query (Almost) Everything" talk](https://www.hytradboi.com/2022/how-to-query-almost-everything)
from the [HYTRADBOI 2022](https://www.hytradboi.com/) conference.
Instructions for running the demo are available together with the source code
in the `demo-hytradboi` directory:
[link](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/tree/main/demo-hytradboi).

For a brief overview of the query language and an example of using it to query APIs, check the
`demo-hackernews` directory for a simpler demo only querying the HackerNews APIs: [link](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/tree/main/demo-hackernews).

Python bindings are available, and are built automatically on every change to the engine; the most recent version may be downloaded [here](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/releases). A getting started guide for Python is
forthcoming ([tracking issue](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/issues/16)); in the meantime,
the best resource is the Python bindings'
[test suite](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/blob/main/pytrustfall/pytrustfall/tests/test_execution.py).

## Directory Registry

- `trustfall_core` contains the query engine itself: [link](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/tree/main/trustfall_core)
- `pytrustfall` contains `pyo3`-based Python bindings for the `trustfall` engine: [link](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall/tree/main/pytrustfall)
- `demo-hackernews` contains an example use case: querying the HackerNews APIs.
- `demo-hytradboi` contains the demo code from the "How to Query (Almost) Everything" talk
  at the [HYTRADBOI 2022](https://www.hytradboi.com/) conference.
- `demo-feeds` is an example implementation querying RSS feeds using Rust and `trustfall`.
- `demo-metar` is an example implementation querying METAR aviation weather reports using Rust
  and `trustfall`.
- `filetests_proc_macro` is a procedural macro used to generate test cases defined by files:
  they ensure that the function under test, when given an input specified by one file,
  produces an output equivalent to the contents of another file.
