# Trustfall schemas

Datasets in Trustfall are described using a [schema](../glossary.md#schema). The schema describes the shape of each data point in the dataset, and how different data points are connected to each other.

The schema is used to validate and type-check queries, making sure they are valid before attempting to execute them. It also powers editor conveniences such as code auto-complete.

## Schema components overview

In Trustfall, all datasets are modelled as a graph, consisting of [typed][vertex-type] [vertices][vertex] containing [properties][property], and connected to each other by [edges][edge].

Since editor auto-complete also relies on schema data, Trustfall [directives][directive] are included in each Trustfall schema. Their definitions specify the query positions where each directive is valid and may be suggested as a code auto-completion. The schema directives section is always the same for any given Trustfall version, and must not be changed by hand.

### Example setup

Consider a hypothetical social media app called "Flutter" where users may post public messages, "like" each other's posts, and follow other users' activity.

In this section, we'll build up a Trustfall schema for the Flutter app step by step.

```graphql

In the Flutter data model:
- A specific user of Flutter would be represented as a [vertex][vertex].
- All user vertices together represent the schema's `User` [vertex type][vertex-type].
- Each user has a username â€” that's a [property][property] of the `User` vertex type.
- Users may follow each other's activity: the schema models that as the `follows` [edge][edge] on the `User` [vertex type][vertex-type].
- If user `A` follows other users `X` and `Y`, we say that vertex `A` has `follows` edges to `X` and `Y`. A given user may have zero, one, or more `follows` edges.
