# Trustfall schemas

Datasets in Trustfall are described using a [schema](../glossary.md#schema). The schema describes the shape of each data point in the dataset, and how different data points are connected to each other.

The schema is used to validate and type-check queries, making sure they are valid before attempting to execute them. It also powers editor conveniences such as code auto-complete.

## Schema components overview

In Trustfall, all datasets are modelled as a graph, consisting of [typed][vertex-type] [vertices][vertex] containing [properties][property], and connected to each other by [edges][edge].

Since editor auto-complete also relies on schema data, Trustfall [directives][directive] are included in each Trustfall schema. Their definitions specify the query positions where each directive is valid and may be suggested as a code auto-completion. The schema directives section is always the same for any given Trustfall version, and must not be changed by hand.

### Example setup

Consider a hypothetical social media app called "Flutter" where users may post public messages, "like" each other's posts, and follow other users' activity.

In this section, we'll build up a Trustfall schema for the Flutter app step by step.

    """
    author: User!
}
```

## Vertex types and properties

A [vertex][vertex] is akin to a table in SQL, given our Flutter example where
we have users and they may post things, or follow other users we can see we have
two clear vertices. A User vertex and a Post vertex.

A vertex can have properties associated with it (similar to columns in SQL), and
edges. We'll initially just focus on properties as these are the simplest case.
For a user we can imagine the following properties as a minimum:

* `url`: the URL to the users profile page (REQUIRED)
* `username`: the unique username of the account (REQUIRED)
* `display_name`: the name we display for the user (OPTIONAL)

With these two properties we can define a type for the schema called `User` which
looks as follows:

```graphql
"""
A user account on Flutter.
"""
type User {
    """
    The URL of this user's profile page.
    """
    url: String!

    """
    The user's unique username. All users are required to have one.
    """
    username: String!

    """
    The name the user would like to be known by, if any was set.

    If the user has not set a display name, this value will be `null`.
    """
    display_name: String
}
```

Here we've defined three string properties with doc comments to describe them. We've 
also made `url` and `username` required fields by adding the `!` suffix to the type. This
means that the value can't be null. Alternatively, `display_name` is allowed to be
`null` as it is just a `String`.

We'll now also define our `Post` type, this will be very similar with a url to the post and
a message representing the post. For now the user who posted it will be omitted and covered
in the Edges section.

```graphql
"""
A message posted by a Flutter user.
"""
type Post implements Webpage {
    """
    The URL of this post.
    """
    url: String!

    """
    The contents of the posted message.
    """
    message: String!
}
```

## Edges

For our two vertices, we might want to query data that refers to other vertices. This is
what edges are for - relationships between other vertex types. For our user, these edges will
be the posts the user has created, and a list of the other users they follow. Adding these
to the vertex we now get the following schema type:

```graphql
"""
A user account on Flutter.
"""
type User {
    # own properties
    """
    The URL of this user's profile page.
    """
    url: String!

    """
    The user's unique username. All users are required to have one.
    """
    username: String!

    """
    The name the user would like to be known by, if any was set.

    If the user has not set a display name, this value will be `null`.
    """
    display_name: String
    # end of properties

    # edges
    """
    The messages posted by this user, if any.
    """
    posts: [Post!]

    """
    The users this user follows, if any.
    """
    follows: [User!]
}
```

Here we've split properties and edges and used non-doc comments such as `# own properties`
to signal this. Also, as a user can make multiple posts and follow multiple people the type
of both edges is a list. Posts is a list of non-null post objects with the type `[Post!]` and
follows is similar a list of non-null users `[User!]`.

Applying a similar change to Post we now add an edge for the author of the post, a single non-null
User.

```graphql
"""
A message posted by a Flutter user.
"""
type Post {
    # own properties
    """
    The URL of this post.
    """
    url: String!

    """
    The contents of the posted message.
    """
    message: String!

    # edges
    """
    The user who authored this post.

    Each post has precisely one author.
    """
    author: User!
}
```

## Interfaces

Both the User and Post vertex types have a url field, we can therefore have them both implement
the same interface. Interfaces are similar to GraphQL and programming languages which use them
in that we can define a set of properties an interface must provide and also set our edge and
query types to be interfaces instead of concrete types. Let's add a webpage interface to contain
the URL field and have our vertex types implement it:

```graphql
"""
A piece of data that has its own webpage.
"""
interface Webpage {
    # properties
    """
    The human-readable URL at which this webpage may be visited.
    """
    url: String!
}

"""
A user account on Flutter.
"""
type User implements Webpage {
    # properties from Webpage
    """
    The URL of this user's profile page.
    """
    url: String!

    # own properties
    """
    The user's unique username. All users are required to have one.
    """
    username: String!

    """
    The name the user would like to be known by, if any was set.

    If the user has not set a display name, this value will be `null`.
    """
    display_name: String
    # end of properties

    # own edges
    """
    The messages posted by this user, if any.
    """
    posts: [Post!]

    """
    The users this user follows, if any.
    """
    follows: [User!]
}

"""
A message posted by a Flutter user.
"""
type Post implements Webpage {
    # properties from Webpage
    """
    The URL of this post.
    """
    url: String!

    # own properties
    """
    The contents of the posted message.
    """
    message: String!

    # own edges
    """
    The user who authored this post.

    Each post has precisely one author.
    """
    author: User!
}
```

## Entrypoints

An entrypoint gives us an initial set of vertices to work with. Each Trustfall schema needs
a root element called `schema` with a field `query` that is our entrypoint type â€” the starting
point of the query.

In the entrypoint we want to provide the means to query our data source for the initial set of
vertices we'll consider and filter or transform. For data sources like APIs we'll usually define
some queries that map to API queries. For data types where all the data is already present such
as a schema representing something like a json file our entrypoint type may well have no queries
and just properties and/or edges. 

For this hypothetic Flutter app, we'll define an entrypoint type with two queries:

1. Find a user by their username
2. Search for posts with a given search query

Adding this into the schema would look like the following:

```graphql
schema {
    query: Entrypoints
}

type Entrypoints {
    """
    Find a specific user by their username, if they exist.
    """
    FindUser(username: String!): User

    """
    Run a search across all public posts with the given search terms.
    """
    SearchPosts(text: String!): [Post!]
}
```

Here our `FindUser` query takes a non-null string argument `username` and returns a `User`
which may or may not be null. The `SearchPosts` query takes a non-null string argument `text`
and returns a list of non-null `Post` where the list would be empty if there were no matching
posts.
