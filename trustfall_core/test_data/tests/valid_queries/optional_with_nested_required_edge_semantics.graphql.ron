    // This query tests an edge case of the semantics of `@optional` with a nested required edge.
    //
    // `@optional` applies *only* to whether the edge exists. After the edge is resolved,
    // subsequent edges are resolved normally. If the thus-resolved vertices fail to have
    // a subsequent required edge, they are discarded.
    //
    // We *do not* get to "retroactively" pretend that the edge did not exist at the `@optional`
    // and thereby preserve that result set with nulls for the `@optional` contents.
    //
    // Our "numbers" dataset doesn't include any negative numbers,
    // so the number 0 doesn't have a predecessor.
    // If the below query returns *any* data, that's a bug.
