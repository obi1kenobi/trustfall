# Some of the experiment crates use Trustfall as an "external" dependency:
# they use a crate defined outside this repo that depends on Trustfall.
# This makes it difficult to use the local Trustfall together with the external one;
# patch all Trustfall uses to use the internal ones until we find a better solution.
